# ESRI Arcade Code Snippets

This folder contains Arcade expression templates and functions.

## General Workflow

Each expression lives in a Markdown file, which contains a general description of the expression, its use case, a depiction of the result, the code to copy, and an example of an executable form of the expression along with its output. It may also include a link to a web map demonstrating the expression in action.

See the list below for shared expressions.
